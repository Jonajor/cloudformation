# You should always update Security Group Access with your own IP Address to ensure your instances security.

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: >
    This template contains the security groups required by our entire stack.
    We create them in a seperate nested template, so they can be referenced
    by all of the other nested templates.

Parameters:

  VPCParameter:
    Description: "VPC to launch instances into"
    Type: "AWS::EC2::VPC::Id"

  PublicSubnet1Parameter:
    Description: "Subnets to launch instances into"
    Type: "String"

  PublicSubnet2Parameter:
    Description: "Subnets to launch instances into"
    Type: "String"

  EnvironmentName:
    Default: "dev"
    Description: "An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names"
    Type: "String"

Resources:
  # This security group defines who/where is allowed to access the ECS hosts directly.
  # By default we're just allowing access from the load balancer.  If you want to SSH 
  # into the hosts, or expose non-load balanced services you can open their ports here.
